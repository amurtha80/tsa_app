### Scraper — CLT Complete Rebuild
- Investigated active bug: CLT checkpoint names and wait times not aligning
  between API response and page display
- Discovered root cause: original `checkpoint-queues/current` endpoint had been
  returning a frozen payload since `2025-04-19T01:20:02Z` — over 14 months of
  stale data written to DB on every scrape cycle; `generatedAt` field confirmed freeze
- Identified new endpoint: `api.cltairport.mobi/wait-times/checkpoint/CLT` —
  no-auth, 200 response, live data confirmed across multiple independent pulls
- New endpoint returns 6 rows; 2 are orphaned legacy records (`isDisplayable = FALSE`,
  stale `lastUpdatedTimestamp`); 4 are live lanes across Checkpoint 1, 2, and 3
- `CLT_wait_times.R` fully rebuilt against new endpoint using `httr2`:
  - Filters on `isDisplayable == TRUE` to drop orphaned legacy rows
  - Maps `attributes.general` / `attributes.preCheck` flags to `wait_time` /
    `wait_time_pre_check` columns via `case_when()` + `pivot_wider()`
  - Sets `wait_time = NA` when `isOpen == FALSE` regardless of `waitSeconds` value,
    preventing stale closed-checkpoint values from being recorded as real waits
  - `round()` applied to both wait time columns before DB write
  - Explicit `stop()` guard before `pivot_wider()`: fires if any `isDisplayable = TRUE`
    row has neither `attributes.general` nor `attributes.preCheck` set — surfaces
    future CLT API schema changes loudly rather than silently writing a malformed column
  - `print(paste("HTTP Status Code:", status))` removed from production function
- `httr2` added to `foo()` package loader in `scrape_data_automate.R` — CLT is
  the only airport currently using `httr2`; `httr` remains for other airports

### Data — CLT Database Cleanup
- Backed up DB as `tsa_app_backup_pre_clt_cleanup_20260702.duckdb` before any writes
- Deleted 234,888 frozen rows: `airport = 'CLT' AND date >= DATE '2025-04-19'`
- Deleted 36,245 all-NA rows: `airport = 'CLT' AND checkpoint = 'Checkpoint A'` —
  this orphaned row was returned by the old API on every cycle but never contained
  real data for its entire recorded history (Nov 2024 – Apr 2025)
- Remaining CLT data: `Checkpoint 1` and `Checkpoint 3`, Nov 27 2024 – Apr 18 2025,
  36,245 rows each — represents the only period of real, non-frozen CLT data
- Note: historical `"Checkpoint 1"` rows physically represent Checkpoint 2 due to
  a CLT backend naming discrepancy introduced when the new checkpoint opened Nov 2023;
  rename deferred until fresh data accumulates — tracked in TODO

## 2026-06-28

### Data — IAH Checkpoint Name Normalization
- Investigated IAH checkpoint name variants accumulated across three scraper eras
- Era 1 (Dec 2024 – Mar 2026): old scraper wrote names without "IAH" prefix (`Terminal A North` etc.)
- Era 2 (Mar 2026 – present): current scraper correctly writes `IAH Terminal X` canonical names
- Era 3 (Mar 2026 blip): strip-and-pivot logic temporarily failed; lane suffix left in checkpoint name
- Renamed 5 Era 1 checkpoints to canonical `IAH Terminal X` format (~25K rows each)
- Renamed 5 Era 3 blip checkpoints to canonical format (1–1,294 rows each)
- Deleted 2,684 unrecoverable rows: `Loading`, concatenation glitch, all-null Terminal E blip, ambiguous `Terminal E Pre-check`
- Terminal B retained as-is (historical record, outside 365-day aggregation window)
- Final state: 7 clean checkpoints — `Terminal B` plus 6 canonical `IAH Terminal X` names
- Rebuilt `tsa_app_summ.parquet` and pushed to S3
- Cleanup documented in `zz_iah_database_cleanup.R`

### Data — DCA Junk Checkpoint Cleanup
- Investigated `"Opens 4am"` junk value appearing in DCA checkpoint dropdown
- Root cause: earlier version of flyreagan.com security page rendered the
  hours-of-operation notice inside the same `.resp-table-row` CSS class as
  the wait times table; scraper captured it as a checkpoint name
- Page has since been updated — hours text now lives in `<li>` elements and
  is no longer captured by the scraper; no scraper changes required
- Deleted 68 rows where `airport = 'DCA' AND checkpoint = 'Opens 4am'`
- Rebuilt `tsa_app_summ.parquet` and pushed to S3; DCA dropdown confirmed clean
- Cleanup documented in `zz_dca_database_cleanup.R`

---

### Data Pipeline — Nightly Validation Script
- Created `xx_validate_scrape.R`: nightly data quality check that runs ~15 min
  after `xx_build_summary_DB.R` and queries yesterday's raw rows from `tsa_app.duckdb`
- Runs five independent checks each night:
  1. Airport total absence — zero rows for any known airport
  2. Row count drop — yesterday's count below 50% of 7-day rolling average
  3. Checkpoint drop-off — checkpoint absent yesterday but present 5+ of prior 7 days
  4. Implausible wait time values — any value outside 0–120 min range
  5. All-NA standard lane — scraper ran but returned no usable wait time data
- Logs result to `runlog_validate.txt` on every run (pass or fail)
- Sends HTML email alert via blastula when any check fails; skips silently if
  credentials missing
- Email credentials: `SMTP_USER` and `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` in `.Renviron`;
  sending credential stored in Windows keystore via `blastula::create_smtp_creds_key()`
- Scheduled in Windows Task Scheduler; task imported from existing working task
  XML to inherit correct user account context

### Data — DEN Checkpoint Cleanup
- Investigated two DEN TODO items: Pre✓ missing early morning data and 
  South checkpoint weekday sparsity
- Root cause: Great Hall Project renamed North/South → East/West checkpoints;
  CSS scraper wrote corrupt/null checkpoint names Dec 2024 – Jun 2026 during
  transition; API scraper (live since Jul 2025) captures East/West correctly
- Deleted 158,465 rows where `checkpoint IS NULL` (only 1,122 had non-null
  wait times, all Dec 2024 – Feb 2025, too sparse to salvage)
- Renamed checkpoint variants to canonical API names via three UPDATE statements:
  `West` → `East Security` (35,922 rows)
  `South Security` → `West Security` (35,922 rows)
  `South` → `West Security` (1,803 rows)
- `Bridge Security` (2,021 rows, last seen 2024-12-05) left as-is — outside
  rolling 365-day window, never surfaces in app
- Parquet rebuilt manually and pushed to S3; EC2 pulled and Shiny Server restarted
- Added `rm(s3)` to cleanup block in `xx_build_summary_DB.R`
- Saved investigation script as `zz_den_database_cleanup.R` in `02_Scripts/`

## 2026-06-26

### App — UI/UX
- `build_chart()` refactored to accept `lane_label` parameter (`"standard"`, `"precheck"`, `"clear"`); all-NA empty state now renders a lane-specific message instead of the generic fallback — Pre✓ chart displays "No TSA Pre✓ lane at this checkpoint." and CLEAR chart case is pre-wired for when that chart is added
- Both `renderPlot()` call sites updated to pass explicit `lane_label` argument

### AWS Infrastructure
- `flyasap-windows` IAM user scoped to `flyasap-app-data` bucket only via inline policy `flyasap-windows-s3-scoped`; policy grants `s3:PutObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::flyasap-app-data/*` and `s3:ListBucket` on `arn:aws:s3:::flyasap-app-data`; any previously attached broad S3 managed policies removed
- AWS Budget alert configured (`flyasap-monthly-budget`): monthly cost budget with email notification at 85% forecasted and 100% actual spend
- CloudWatch billing alarm configured (`flyasap-billing-alarm`): fires on `EstimatedCharges` exceeding threshold; SNS topic `flyasap-billing-alarm` delivers email notification; billing alerts opt-in enabled at account level (requires root); alarm scoped to us-east-1 (required region for billing metrics)

## 2026-06-25

### App — UI/UX
- Replaced invalid `shield-check` icon (FA Pro only) in TSA Pre✓ card header with `plane-circle-check` (FA6 Free); was generating warnings in Shiny Server logs on every session
- Chart x-axis AM/PM label overflow identified — fix pending (labels spilling into adjacent time slots on mobile)

---

## 2026-06-24

### App — Performance
- `bindCache()` added to both `renderPlot()` calls in `app.R` using default `cache = "app"` — app-scoped in-memory cache shared across sessions; nightly Shiny Server restart clears stale cache automatically
- Note: earlier attempt used `cache = cache_mem()` without `cachem::` namespace, which crashed the app on startup; correct call is `cachem::cache_mem()` but unnecessary here since `bindCache()` default behavior is equivalent

### Infrastructure
- AWS EC2 t3.medium (`flyasap-app`) provisioned on Ubuntu 24.04 in us-east-2
- Shiny Server + nginx configured; Let's Encrypt SSL live for `flyasap.app` (.app TLD mandates HTTPS)
- Cloudflare DNS A record pointing to Elastic IP `3.21.184.42`
- IAM users `flyasap-admin` and `flyasap-windows` created; IAM role `flyasap-ec2-s3-read` attached to EC2
- S3 bucket `flyasap-app-data` created in us-east-2
- AWS credentials stored in `.Renviron` on Windows desktop (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`)
- EC2 nightly cron job configured (3 AM) — pulls parquet from S3, restarts Shiny Server
- **App is live at https://flyasap.app**

### Data Pipeline
- Windows Task Scheduler nightly job configured (2 AM) to run `xx_build_summary_DB.R`
- Parquet export added to `xx_build_summary_DB.R` via `nanoparquet::write_parquet()`
- S3 push added to `xx_build_summary_DB.R` via `paws` (called inline to avoid `glue` 1.8.0 conflict); wrapped in `tryCatch`; bucket `flyasap-app-data`
- `app.R` updated to read `tsa_app_summ.parquet` via `nanoparquet::read_parquet()` at startup, replacing DuckDB/DBI read
- `app_sidebar.R` renamed to `app.R` for Shiny Server compatibility

## 2026-06-23

### App — Performance
- `bucket_label` display format changed from 24-hour to 12-hour (`%I:%M %p`) at render time; underlying `bucket_time` filter key preserved as `"HH:MM:SS"` character

---

## 2026-06-19

### Branding
- Domain `flyasap.app` purchased through Cloudflare (`.app` TLD)
- Social handles `@flyasapapp` secured across X, Instagram, TikTok, and Threads
- App name confirmed as ASAP; brand descriptor "Know before you go."
- Confirmed that descriptive use of "TSA" in copy/metadata is legally safe; TSA logo and government affiliation claims are not

---

## 2026-06-17

### Housekeeping
- `xx_cleanup_temp_files.R` written using `unlink(recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)` to remove `HeadlessChrome*` and `Rtmp*` temp folders generated by headless Chrome on Windows; filed in `02_Scripts/`

---

## 2026-06-15

### App — UI/UX
- Settings offcanvas drawer (dark mode + color toggle) removed for MVP
- Fixed theme: Navy `#2C3E7F` primary, Teal `#18BC9C` accent
- Inter + DM Serif Display loaded via Google Fonts
- Hero band added below navbar with headline "Know before you go." and one-line descriptor
- Smart defaults: day and time selectors auto-set from `Sys.time()` on session start
- Day + time selectors displayed side-by-side on mobile via `layout_columns(col_widths = c(6, 6))`
- Donate prompt changed from pinned footer to 30-second delayed Bootstrap 5 toast
- `selectizeInput` replaced with `selectInput(..., selectize = FALSE)` across all four dropdowns to prevent mobile virtual keyboard from triggering on dropdown interaction
- Chart text and dot sizing increased for mobile readability
- `annotate("text", fontface = "bold")` replaced with `geom_text()` on `data[1, ]` — `annotate()` silently ignores `fontface` in ggplot2

---

## 2026-06-12

### App — Architecture
- `xx_build_summary_DB.R` written: nightly ETL reads `tsa_app.duckdb`, aggregates into 15-minute buckets by airport/checkpoint/weekday, writes `tsa_app_summ.duckdb` and exports `tsa_app_summ.parquet`
- `bucket_time` stored as `"HH:MM:SS"` character in DuckDB (not raw `hms` seconds) to prevent comparison failures on read; parsed back to `hms` in app
- Two-database architecture adopted: `tsa_app.duckdb` for scraping writes, `tsa_app_summ.duckdb` for app reads — avoids DuckDB concurrent read/write constraint without requiring beta Quack protocol
- `app.R` built on bslib/Bootstrap 5 with `page_fillable()`, `layout_columns()`, `breakpoints(sm = 12, lg = c(3, 9))`, and custom `tags$nav` navbar
- Checkpoint dropdown dynamically populated from selected airport via pre-computed lookup at startup; `updateSelectInput()` used at runtime
- `build_chart()` helper renders both standard and TSA Pre✓ lane charts with `ggrounded` rounded bars, avg bar labels, and max wait dot annotation
- Double newlines in `runlog.txt` fixed: replaced `print(glue(...))` with `cat(glue(...), "\n")` inside `sink()`

### Scraper Fixes
- All 12 active airport scrapers passing in orchestrator run (~1 min 39 sec per cycle)
- ATL: fixed terminal/checkpoint name building; handled closed checkpoints marked as `"X"`
- DCA: rewrote scraping to use `purrr::map_chr` pulling cells by position from `.resp-table-row` — eliminated `stri_list2matrix` ragged matrix failures
- JFK + LGA: updated to new Port Authority Chakra UI selector; `"No Wait"` → `0` conversion added
- EWR: updated selector; concatenated `Terminal + Gates` columns for granular checkpoint names; `"No Wait"` → `0` conversion added

### Scraper Fixes
- DEN: pivoted from Cloudflare-blocked chromote scrape to backend API at `app.flyfruition.com/api/public/tsa`; `upper_bound()` helper parses range strings (e.g., `"9-13"`) conservatively
- JFK, LGA, EWR (Port Authority): updated CSS selectors from `.av-responsive-table` to `.chakra-table__root.Table_tableContainer__Hwsqp` following 2026 site redesign

---

## 2026-06-10

### Scraper Fixes
- IAH: rewrote `IAH_error.R` → `IAH_wait_times.R`; single-pass scrape replaces old two-pass tab-click; `pivot_wider()` splits Standard/PreCheck/Premier lane types into schema columns; June 2026 `tryCatch` teardown pattern applied
- `chrome-headless-shell` binary (`chromote::local_chrome_version(version = "latest-stable", binary = "chrome-headless-shell")`) added inside all chromote scrape functions — eliminates `HeadlessChrome*` temp file accumulation (was generating 100GB+ per day)
- Teardown pattern standardized across all chromote scripts: `page$session$close()` → `page$session$parent$close(wait = 3)` → `chromote::set_default_chromote_object(NULL)` guard, wrapped in `tryCatch`
- `reset_chromote()` helper added to `scrape_data_automate.R` — clears lingering default chromote object before each airport function call
- `safe_read_html_live()` rewritten to throw catchable errors instead of calling `quit()` — enables `tryCatch` isolation in orchestrator

### New Airports (Research)
- BOS: Zensors tRPC API reverse-engineered; `BOS_wait_times.R` drafted using `purrr::pmap()` over checkpoint map; needs live test
- LAX: `flylax.com/wait-times` confirmed as static HTML; `LAX_wait_times.R` drafted using `read_html()` + `html_table()`; needs live test
- SEA, SLC, DTW: domain-blocked from static fetch; require live DevTools investigation before scripting

---

## 2026-06-06

### Scraper — Orchestrator
- `tryCatch` error isolation added to `lapply` in `run_all_functions()` — individual airport failures no longer kill the entire orchestrator run
- Single retry pass added for failed airports after primary run completes
- `bitops` package identified as missing RSelenium transitive dependency; resolved with `install.packages("bitops")`

---

## 2026-05-31
